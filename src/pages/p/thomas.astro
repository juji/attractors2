  In the dynamical systems theory, 
  Thomas' cyclically symmetric attractor is a 3D strange attractor 
  originally proposed by Ren√© Thomas. 
  It has a simple form which is cyclically symmetric in the x,y, 
  and z variables and can be viewed as the trajectory of a frictionally 
  dampened particle moving in a 3D lattice of forces. 
  The simple form has made it a popular example.

  For me, it looks like Voldermort's magic.
