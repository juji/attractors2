<p>
  The Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations 
  first studied by mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz. 
</p>
<p>
  In popular media the "butterfly effect" stems from the real-world 
  implications of the Lorenz attractor, 
  namely that several different initial chaotic conditions evolve in phase 
  space in a way that never repeats, so all chaos is unpredictable.
